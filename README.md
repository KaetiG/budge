**Group Project**: Budge: An entrepreneurial mobile-first web application ideated by our clients, who saw a need for reducing wait times at local busy restaurants.
Alongside three other developers, we collaborated with our clients in a deadline-driven development environment to create a solution for this common issue in the restaurant industry.

Users can:
•View participating restaurants in their neighborhoods
•View that establishment’s current waitlist, join the waitlist themselves
•Offer to trade places with another user that has a shorter wait time in exchange
for payment.
